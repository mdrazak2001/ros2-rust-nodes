# ROS2 Rust Nodes - Custom ROS 2 Workspace with Rust

ðŸš€ This repository is a **ROS 2 workspace** (`ros2_ws`) that contains a set of ROS 2 nodes written in Rust that demonstrate publisher/subscriber communication using the [ros2_rust](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust) client library.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **ROS 2 (ex Humble Hawksbill):** Follow the [ROS 2 Installation guide for Ubuntu](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).
- **Rust Toolchain:** Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- colcon (for building the workspace)


## 2. Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Install and Build `ros2_rust`

Follow the instructions in [ros2-rust/ros2_rust](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust) to install Rust bindings for ROS 2.
Once cloned and set up, build it inside your workspace (e.g., ~/workspace):

```bash
cd ~/workspace
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### Step 2: Build This Workspace

This repository is already structured as a ROS 2 workspace. After cloning it, ensure it sources the `ros2_rust` build:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash # Source the previously installed ros2 humble setup files
source ~/workspace/install/setup.bash  # Source ros2_rust
colcon build
source install/local_setup.bash
```
``Note: The source install/local_setup.bash ensures both ros2_rust and this package are properly linked.``

## 3. Running the Rust Nodes

### Command Line Arguments

#### Publisher Node Arguments
```bash
ros2 run rust_nodes simple_publisher <topic_name> <publish_rate_ms> <prefix> <suffix> <count_start>
```
- `topic_name`: Name of the ROS2 topic to publish to
- `publish_rate_ms`: Publication rate in milliseconds
- `prefix`: Text to appear before the counter
- `suffix`: Text to appear after the counter
- `count_start`: Initial value of the counter

#### Subscriber Node Arguments
```bash
ros2 run rust_nodes simple_subscriber <topic_name> <output_file>
```
- `topic_name`: Name of the ROS2 topic to subscribe to
- `output_file`: Path to the file where received messages will be logged


## Manual Run
You can run the nodes manually using the `ros2 run` command. For example:

**Publisher:**
```bash
ros2 run rust_nodes simple_publisher my_topic 1000 "Hello" "World" 0
# Publishes: "Hello 0 World", "Hello 1 World", etc. every 1 second
```

**Subscriber:**
```bash
ros2 run rust_nodes simple_subscriber my_topic ./subscriber_output.txt
```

## Launch Files

For convenience, we have provided multi-level Python launch files under `src/rust_nodes/launch`.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/rust_nodes/launch
ros2 launch main_launch.py
```


## 4. Important Notes
âš  Configuring `.cargo/config.toml`
This repository includes a `.cargo/config.toml` file, which must be modified for different environments:

- It contains local file paths that reference built dependencies in `ros2_rust`.

- Update the paths in .cargo/config.toml to match your setup after building ros2_rust.

- If the paths are incorrect, the build may fail due to missing dependencies.

Example:
If `ros2_rust` was built in `/home/user/my_ros2_rust_workspace`, update:

```toml
[patch.crates-io.rclrs]
path = "/home/user/my_ros2_rust_workspace/install/rclrs/share/rclrs/rust"
```
